## Introduction
Hello there! Welcome to the Python Chatbot Lab! In this lab, you will start by learning/reviewing Python basics. Then you will build a working chatbot in Python that you can interect via Command Line Interface (CLI)!

**Please feel free to ask any questions! We are always here to help! The more questions you ask, you more you will get out of this coding camp!**

### Q&A: What is Command Line Interface
A command-line interface (CLI) is a way of interacting with a computer program where the user (YOU) gives commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (aka command lines).

## Open a Python CLI
- Go to Start
- Search for Python
- Click and open IDLE and you will see a window like below:

- Now you are able to issue commands by typing Python code into CLI

### Q&A: What is IDLE
IDLE is an powerful development environment for Python that includes both Python CLI and Python file (.py) editor, which we will learn and use in this lab. Please note that you can still write Python code and issue Python commands without IDLE, as long as Python is installed.
